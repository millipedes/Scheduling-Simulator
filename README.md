# :tropical_fish: CPU Simulator
## :dart: Project Description/Goal
This project was designed to give users an interface to experiment with
scheduling algorithms.

This is a subject that personally I am interested in but have found no other
solution than to make a full new environment.  I read the manual for the linux
kernel sceheduler and attempted to just see how deeply in the code base the CFS
scheduler was. Turns out pretty deep (13+ source files and a bunch of instances
of it elsewhere). I also attempted to look at the BSD kernel scheduler but got
even less far in that endevour. Thus I have written a toy environment with easy
extensibility by the user to test whatever scheduling algorithm they wish.
